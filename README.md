* To get started, download the files in a zip file by pressing the green "code" button and pressing "Download ZIP", or [click this link](https://github.com/unkn0wnF/YMW11DIT/archive/refs/heads/main.zip) to download the ZIP.
* Once downloaded, unzip the ZIP file and open the extracted folder in [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/).
* Ensure you have the [Live Server extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ritwickdey.LiveServer) installed, as this will make it easier to view the website on a development server.
